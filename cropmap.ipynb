    "1. **Select valid TIFF files**: Identify TIFF files that overlap with the Ukrainian boundary.\n",
    "2. **Merge valid TIFF files for a specific year**: Extract the band corresponding to the specified year and merge the overlapping files.\n",
    "3. **Mask the merged image with the Ukrainian boundary**: Apply the Ukrainian polygon as a mask to retain only the cultivated areas within the boundary.\n",
    "4. **Save the result for each year**: Save the masked image as a new TIFF file for each specified year.\n",
